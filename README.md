# My Portfolio Website

This project is to develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I will complete throughout the course of Udacity's Nanodegree program.

You can view it live here: https://myportfoliodaikikuchi.appspot.com/

All content is responsive and displays on all display sizes. This includes:

- Desktop
- Mobile: Google Nexus 5
- Tablet: Apple iPad

An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.

All content is rendered on all three devices. No content should be hidden on mobile devices.
